# Leap-Control-Car

This is my 2nd-year undergraduate project. I worked with Anand to successfully complete this project. We modified a remote control car to work with Leap Motion Sensor. The leap motion sensor is a device that recognizes our hand gestures. We were controlling the car by using different gestures.

Please watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9C1Q_n0wo) youtube video to understand better what we made.
